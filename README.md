# Find Middle Index

### Function Explanation

The  `findMiddleIndex`  function takes an array of integers and returns the index where the sum of elements on the left side of that index equals the sum of elements on the right side. If no such index exists, it returns "index not found". The function operates efficiently with a time complexity of O(n), iterating through the array once to determine the result.
